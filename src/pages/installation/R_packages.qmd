title: "Installing R Packages"
---

How you install **R** packages depends on whether you are using a **conda environment**. See our page on [conda environments](/pages/installation/conda.qmd) to learn how conda can help with **version control** and **reproducibility**. If you’re working within a conda environment, follow the conda installation instructions. Otherwise, you can install  packages within your R script.

## Conda Installation
```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge r-<package_name>
```
Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you wish to install.

## R Installation
In R, you can install packages directly from within your script using the `install.packages()` function. For example, to install **ggplot2**, a popular package for data visualization, include the following line at the beginning of your script:
```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
