The two most commonly used are:\n\n* **NAC workflow** – quantifies nascent (unspliced) transcripts. This workflow is typically used for **single-nucleus RNA-seq** experiments, where a substantial portion of captured mRNA remains unspliced.\n\n* **Standard workflow** – quantifies mature (fully spliced) transcripts. This workflow is suitable when you are interested only in processed mRNA.\n\n## Step 1: Generate a Reference Index\nThe first step of any RNA-seq analysis is aligning your reads to a reference genome. To do this, kb-python requires a reference index representing the set of target transcripts to which your reads will be mapped.\n\n### Using a Default Index\nkb-python conveniently has a precompiled set of indices for the following species:\n\n* human\n* mouse\n* dog \n* monkey\n* zebrafish\n\nFor the **standard workflow**, you can load the human index as follows:\n\n```bash\nkb ref -d human -i index.idx -g t2g.txt\n```\n\nwhich will create the files index.idx and t2g.txt.\n\nand for the **nascent workflow**,\n\n```bash\nkb ref --workflow=nac -d human -i index.idx \\ \n    -g t2g.txt -c1 cdna.txt -c2 nascent.txt\n```\n\nwhich will additionally generate the files cdna.txt and nascent.txt.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSee how the precompiled indices were generated [here](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto-transcriptome-indices)\n:::\n\n### Generating a Custom Index\nIn order to make a custom index, you must specify a **genome FASTA reference file** and a **GTF annotation file** from which to extract the transcript sequences. You can obtain these files from [**ENSEMBL**](https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html). We recommend using the **primary assembly FASTA file** (ends `.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz`).\n\nThen, to generate an index for the **standard workflow**, run:\n```bash\nkb ref  -i index.idx -g t2g.txt -f1 cdna.fasta genome.fasta genome.gtf\n```\n\nand for the **nac workflow**, run:\n```bash\nkb ref --workflow=nac -i index.idx -g t2g.txt -c1 cdna.txt -c2 nascent.txt \\\n    -f1 cdna.fasta -f2 nascent.fasta genome.fasta genome.gtf\n```\n\n## Step 2: Align to Reference Genome\nThe next step is to generate a count matrix by pseudoaligning the reads to your reference index using the `kb count` command. For example, suppose you have two paired-end FASTQ files (read1.fastq and read2.fastq) from a 10x Chromium NextGen v3 library.\n\nFor the **standard workflow**, you can perform pseudoalignment with:\n\n```bash\nkb count -i index_file.idx -g t2g_file.txt -x 10XV3 \\\n    -o output_dir read1.fastq read2.fastq\n```\n\nand for the **nascent workflow**,\n\n```bash\nkb count --workflow=nac -i index_file.idx -g t2g_file.txt -c1 cdna.txt \\\n    -c2 nascent.txt -x 10XV3 -o output_dir read1.fastq read2.fastq\n```\n\nwhere `output_dir` is the folder where you wish the results of `kb_count` to be stored.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"What is a FASTQ file?\"}\nFASTQ files are the standard format for storing raw sequencing reads from next-generation sequencing instruments. Each read in a FASTQ file is represented by four lines:\n\n```ruby\n@SEQ_ID\nGATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT\n+\n!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65\n```\n\n* **Line 1** – Read identifier (begins with @)\n\n* **Line 2** – Nucleotide sequence\n\n* **Line 3** – Separator line (usually just +)\n\n* **Line 4** – Quality scores for each base (encoded as ASCII characters)\n\n`kb count` accepts both raw and gzipped FASTQ files. If your reads are stored in another file format, you will have to convert to FASTQ before pseudoalignment with kb-python.\n:::\n\nChange `-x 10XV3` according to the specific technology you used to generate your library.\n\n* 10X Chromium GEM-X V4: `-x 10XV4`\n* Parse Evercode WT v2: `-x SPLITSEQ`\n\nTo see a complete list of technologies and their corresponding technology strings, type `kb --list` into your terminal.\n\n### Parse Evercode WT v3: Using a Custom Specification\n\nCurrently, **kb-python** does not include a built-in specification for the **Parse Evercode WT v3** chemistry. To pseudoalign Parse v3 data, you must manually specify the assay configuration by providing:\n\n* <a href=\"v3_onlist.txt\" download>v3_onlist.txt</a> — a list of valid cell barcodes\n\n* a technology string defining barcode positions within the read: `-x \"1,10,18,1,30,38,1,50,58:1,0,10:0,0,0\"`\n\n* the orientation of the first read (R1) with relative to your library specification: `--strand=forward`\n\n* the read parity (whether the assay produces single- or paired-end reads): `--paired=paired`\n\nThen, run:\n```bash\nkb count --h5ad --strand=forward --parity=paired \\\n  -w v3_onlist.txt -x \"1,10,18,1,30,38,1,50,58:1,0,10:0,0,0 \\\n  -g t2g.txt -i index.idx R1.fastq.gz R2.fastq.gz\n```\n\n### Parse Evercode WT: Substituting Barcodes with the `-r` Argument\nThe Parse Evercode WT chemistry is unique in that each cell has two cell-specific barcodes rather than one. Since kb-python expects a single barcode per cell, you must collapse barcode pairs before pseudoalignment.\nThis is done using the -r argument in kb count, for example:\n\n```bash\nkb count -r <replace_file> ...\n```\n\nwhere \\<replace_file\\> is a **TSV** file with two columns:\n\n* Column 1: barcodes to be replaced\n\n* Column 2: corresponding replacement barcodes\n\nYou can download:\n\n* v2_replace.txt for v2 chemistry <a href=\"v2_replace.txt\" download>here</a>\n\n* v3_replace.txt for v3 chemistry <a href=\"v3_replace.txt\" download>here</a>\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nWhen using `-r` to specify a replacement list in kb count, two count matrices will be produced: one with the original barcodes (stored in the output file `counts_unfiltered`) and one with the replacement barcodes (stored in the output file `counts_unfiltered_modified`).\n:::\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter generating your count matrix, you can import it into analysis tools such as **Scanpy**, **Seurat**, or **Bioconductor** for downstream processing, clustering, and visualization.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis tutorial provides a brief introduction to kb-python.\nFor a more in-depth guide, see the [official documentation](https://kallisto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and reference the papers for [kb-python](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-024-01057-0), [bustools](http://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/21/4472/5487510?login=true), and [kallisto](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3519).\n:::\n\n**kb-python** is a lightweight, command-line toolkit for processing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
