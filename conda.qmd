title: "Creating a Conda Environment"

## Why Should I Use Conda?
Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that simplifies software installation and version control. It ensures that scientific computing workflows are reproducible, portable, and isolated — ideal for complex bioinformatics pipelines.

* Install and manage software (including **Python** and **R** packages) along with all their dependencies

* Create isolated environments so different projects can use different versions of the same software without conflicts.

* Reproduce analyses easily since an environment file (environment.yml) can capture the exact software versions used in your workflow.

This makes conda especially useful for computational biology and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, where multiple specialized tools (e.g., kb-python, scanpy, seqspec) must work together seamlessly.

To install Conda, follow the [Miniconda installation instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install).  
**Miniconda** is the lightweight version of Anaconda and is recommended for most users.

## Create a New Environment
There are many ways to organize your Conda environments, depending on your workflow and software dependencies.
As a general rule, create a dedicated Conda environment for each project to prevent version conflicts and ensure reproducibility.

To create a conda environment (with Python), type into the command line:

```bash
conda create --name myenv
```

and replace `myenv` with your desired environment name. Then, to activate your environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Now, anything you run in this shell will use only the packages that you have explicitly installed. To deactivate your environment, run:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

:::{.callout-note title="Python or R?"}
To create your environment with a specific version of **Python** (e.g version 3.12), type into your command line:
```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.12
```

If your project uses **R** instead you can create an environment as follows (here using version 4.2):
```bash
conda create --name myenv r-essentials r-base=4.2
```

## Installing a Package with Conda
To install a package with Conda, you usually have to **specify a channel** — an online repository where packages are stored and distributed. Conda channels are online repositories where packages are stored and distributed. When you install a package with conda, it looks for that package in one or more channels (for example, defaults, conda-forge, or bioconda).

* **defaults**  — maintained by Anaconda; includes general-purpose packages.  

* **conda-forge** - a community-maintained channel providing up-to-date, cross-platform scientific software.  uilds of thousands of scientific and technical packages.

* **bioconda** — specializes in bioinformatics software and builds on conda-forge for its dependencies.

When installing bioinformatics tools like kb-python or seqspec, it’s best practice to specify both conda-forge and bioconda as channels to ensure compatibility:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda kb-python
```

## Recreate an Old Environment
You can save your conda environment in a **YAML** file with:
```bash
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
```
The `--from-history` flag saves only the packages you explicitly installed, keeping the file concise.
If you prefer to include all dependencies and versions, omit this flag.

To recreate the same environment elsewhere:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name myenv
```
